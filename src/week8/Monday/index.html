    <div id="section" class="section">
            <p><strong>The first reason</strong> and, without a doubt, one of the most important, is that the technological world is in constant development, which makes the future of programmers very promising.</p>
            <p>This leads us to a <strong>second</strong> reason and it is the labor demand that is generated thanks to this second technological growth, therefore, as a programmer you will always have open doors in terms of employment.</p>
            <p><strong>The third</strong> and the reason I like the most for being a programming leader is knowing that web programming is one of the best paid careers globally, because technology is advancing at a gigantic pace and there are currently few professionals in this industry.</p>
