    <li>Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNMy969SjyU" rel="nofollow">this</a> video about compilation and interpretation <span>&#10003; Done</span></li> 
    <li>Search and answer the question: Java language is compiled or interpreted? <span>&#10003; Done</span></li>
      <ul>
        <li><span><strong>Answer:</strong></span> Java is both Interpreted and compiled. The Java source code first compiled into a binary byte code using Java compiler, then this byte code runs on the JVM (Java Virtual Machine), which is a software based interpreter. So Java is considered as both interpreted and compiled.</li>

    <li>Create an algorithm to calculate the equivalent of your local currencty to USD <span>&#10003; Done</span></li>

    <li>Read about Pseudocode <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-pseudocode-in-programming/" rel="nofollow">here</a>, you can also find some examples <a href="/corecodeio/bootcamp-from-scratch/blob/main/resources/PSEUDOCODE.md">here</a> <span>&#10003; Done</span></li>
    <li>Anwser to the question: Why is pseudocode helpful? <span>&#10003; Done</span></li>
      <ul>
        <li><span><strong>Answer:</strong></span> I think that writing pseudocode before coding is certainly better than just coding without planning, but it's far from being a best practice. Test-driven development is an improvement.</li> 
      </ul>  
    <li>Create a pseudocode to calculate the aproximated age of a user base on the year they born, (you can define a variable with the actual year if you need it, like for example i could define Y <-- 2022) <span>&#10003; Done</span></li>
      <ul><li><span><strong>Answer:</strong></span></li></ul>
      <hr>
    <pre><code>
      function calculateAge(yearborn)
        yearActural=2022
        if yearborn = yearActural then
            return 0
        else
            return yearActural -yearborn
        end if
      end function
      input yearborn
      output "You Born in :"+str(yearborn)+ ", And Your Age Is: ", calculateAge(yearborn)

    <li>Read about flowcharts <a href="https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/es/que-es-un-diagrama-de-flujo" rel="nofollow">here</a> <span>&#10003; Done</span></li>
    <li>Answer to the question: Why are flowcharts important to us as developers? <span>&#10003; Done</span></li>
      <ul>
        <li><span><strong>Answer:</strong></span> Because flow charts help programmers develop the most efficient coding because they can clearly see where the data is going to end up. Flow charts help programmers figure out where a potential problem area is and helps them with debugging or cleaning up code that is not working.</li> 
      </ul>  
    <li>Search about High-level languages and Low-level languages, you can start with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vRPOp5p-qs" rel="nofollow">this</a> video. <span>&#10003; Done</span></li>
